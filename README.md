[00:07.07] You say
[00:09.78] The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
[00:15.33] You cry
[00:17.84] In your tea, which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
[00:47.84] 
[00:23.38] Why so sad?
[00:26.06] Remember, we made an arrangement when you went away
[00:30.72] Now, you're making me mad
[00:34.17] Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
[00:58.17] 
[00:41.72] You'll be back, soon, you'll see
[00:45.66] You'll remember you belong to me
[00:49.50] You'll be back, time will tell
[00:53.27] You'll remember that I served you well
[00:57.03] Oceans rise, empires fall
[01:01.16] We have seen each other through it all
[01:05.16] And when push comes to shove
[01:09.01] I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!
[01:39.51] 
[01:14.59] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[01:19.34] Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da
[01:22.32] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[01:27.37] Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya
[01:38.37] 
[01:29.92] You say our love is draining, and you can't go on
[01:37.53] You'll be the one complainin' when I am gone
[01:45.44] And no, don't change the subject
[01:49.53] 'Cause you're my favorite subject
[01:53.49] My sweet, submissive subject
[01:57.19] My loyal, royal subject
[02:01.49] Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[02:22.99] 
[02:11.86] You'll be back like before
[02:15.36] I will fight the fight and win the war
[02:19.13] For your love, for your praise
[02:23.54] And I'll love you 'til my dying days
[02:27.14] When you're gone, I'll go mad
[02:30.63] So don't throw away this thing we had
[02:35.17] 'Cause when push comes to shove
[02:39.88] I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
[03:09.88] 
[02:47.50] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[02:52.24] Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da
[02:55.50] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[03:00.47] Da-da, dat- everybody!
[03:11.47] 
[03:03.36] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[03:07.87] Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da
[03:11.17] Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
[03:15.73] Da-da-da, dat, da-ya-da-ah
